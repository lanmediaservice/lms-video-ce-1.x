<a name="what"></a><h2>What is This?</h2>

<p>The Really Simple History (RSH) framework makes it easy for AJAX applications
to incorporate bookmarking and back and button support. By default, AJAX systems
are not bookmarkable, nor can they recover from the user pressing the browser's
back and forward buttons. The RSH library makes it possible to handle both cases.</p>

<p>In addition, RSH provides a framework to cache transient session information that
persists after a user leaves the web page. This cache is used by the RSH framework
to help with history issues, but can also be used by your own applications to 
improve application performance. The cache is linked to a single instance of the
web page, and will disappear when the user closes their browser or clear their
browser's cache.</p>

<p>RSH works on Internet Explorer 6+ and Gecko-based browsers, like
Firefox. Safari is not supported.</p>

<a name="how"></a><h2>How Do I Use This?</h2>

<p>The RSH framework exposes two primary objects you will use to add history
support to your application: <code>dhtmlHistory</code> and 
<code>historyStorage</code>.</p>

<p><code>dhtmlHistory</code> is the primary entry point for adding bookmark
and back button support to your application. The primary flow when working
with RSH is as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Initialize <code>dhtmlHistory</code></li>
  <li>Register your application as interested in being notified whenever the user
  presses the back or forward buttons.</li>
  <li>Determine the initial location of your application and initialize your
  state accordingly.</li>
  <li>As a user interacts with your AJAX application add history entries
  to the <code>dhtmlHistory</code> object. The history entry specifies a new location,
  such as <code>edit:somePage</code>, as well as some optional contextual data that
  is associated with the new location. When you add a new history entry,
  the RSH framework updates the browser's location bar with the new location,
  added after a hash, such as <code>http://somesite.com/myapp#edit:somePage</code>.</li>
  <li>If a user presses the back or forward buttons, the RSH framework will call
  the history change callback you registered earlier, passing in the new
  location as well as any history data that might have been associated with
  this location by you. The browser's URL field will also jump between any
  previous or next hash history entries.</li> 
</ol>

<p>The chief idea behind RSH is that your application adds custom history 
events as a user interacts with the application; the framework itself uses the
history entry to update the browser's location bar. The only way to update a browser
location without reloading the entire page is by using a hash fragment, so the
new location is added after a hash fragment, such as <code>#edit:somePage</code>. 
When you add a history entry, you can also pass in contextual data that is
associated with this location; this is optional information and can be useful
for sophisticated uses, such as saving the state of an edit form.</p>

<p>If a user presses the back or forward buttons, the RSH framework "jumps" 
through any history entries that were added by the programmer before. The
RSH framework then calls your history change listener, passing in the new
location as well as any history data that was associated with this location.
Your application now has the responsibility of taking this location and updating
it's UI accordingly; RSH doesn't update your UI at all, since this is very
application specific.</p>

<p>You should choose location URLs that contain enough state for you to
update your application or initialize yourself. For example, if the user
jumps to the location <code>#view:somePage</code>, your application should 
be able to use this to know that you must remotely fetch <code>somePage</code>
and view it. Choose location URLs that make sense to your application, recording
enough state to re-initialize themselves.</p>

<p>Finally, you must include a file named <i>blank.html</i> in the same
directory as your application. This file is included with the RSH
download and is needed by Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>Here's some simple pseudo-code on how to use RSH:</p>

<pre><code>/** RSH must be initialized after the
    page is finished loading. */
window.onload = initialize;

function initialize() {
  // initialize RSH
  dhtmlHistory.initialize();
  
  // add ourselves as a listener for history
  // change events
  dhtmlHistory.addListener(handleHistoryChange);
  
  // determine our current location so we can
  // initialize ourselves at startup
  var initialLocation = 
                dhtmlHistory.getCurrentLocation();
  
  // if no location specified, use the default
  if (initialLocation == null)
    initialLocation = "location1";
  
  // now initialize our starting UI
  updateUI(initialLocation, null);
}

/** A function that is called whenever the user
    presses the back or forward buttons. This
    function will be passed the newLocation,
    as well as any history data we associated
    with the location. */
function handleHistoryChange(newLocation,
                             historyData) {
  // use the history data to update our UI
  updateUI(newLocation, historyData);                           
}

/** A simple method that updates our user
    interface using the new location. */
function updateUI(newLocation,
                  historyData) {
  var output = document.getElementById("output");
  
  // simply display the location and the
  // data
  var historyMessage;
  if (historyData != null)
    historyMessage = historyData.message;
    
  var message = "New location: "
                + newLocation 
                + ", history data="
                + historyMessage;
                
  output.innerHTML = message;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our HTML is straightforward; it simply consists of a serious of links
that users can click on, which we use to update the history:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;h1>Output&lt;/h1>
  &lt;div id="output">&lt;/div>
  
  &lt;div onclick="dhtmlHistory.add(
                     'location1', 
                     {message: 'hello world 1'})">
    Change to Location 1                   
  &lt;/div>        
  
  &lt;div onclick="dhtmlHistory.add(
                     'location2', 
                     {message: 'hello world 2'})">
    Change to Location 2                   
  &lt;/div>              
  
  &lt;div onclick="dhtmlHistory.add(
                     'location3', 
                     {message: 'hello world 3'})">
    Change to Location 3                   
  &lt;/div>   
&lt;/body>
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we use <code>dhtmlHistory.add()</code> in the links above
to update the history with a new entry.</p>

<p>RSH also provides an object that can be used to store transient session 
information for the page, named <code>historyStorage</code>. 
<code>historyStorage</code> simulates a hash table, making
it possible to put and get name/value pairs that persist
even after the user has left the web page. Note that
these values are linked just to the single instance of
the web page they were stored on. If the user opens a new browser
window and navigates to your site then the values will not be
visible. For permanent, long-term storage of large amounts
of information you should use the AJAX MAssive Storage System (AMASS) instead.</p>

<p>Sample code for working with <code>historyStorage</code>:</p>

<pre><code>/** RSH must be initialized after the
    page is finished loading. */
window.onload = initialize;

function initialize() {
  // initialize RSH
  dhtmlHistory.initialize();
  
  // storage a value into the historyStorage
  // if it doesn't exist yet; otherwise, grab
  // the pre-existing value from the history
  // storage
  var savedObject;
  if (historyStorage.hasKey("message"))
    savedObject = historyStorage.get("message");
  else {
    savedObject = new Object();
    savedObject.id = "someId";
    savedObject.message = "Hello Watason";
    savedObject.testArray = new Array();
    savedObject.testArray[0] = "Hello";
    savedObject.testArray[1] = "World";
    savedObject.nestedObject = {someProp: "bye"};
    
    historyStorage.put("message", savedObject);
  }
  
  // now work with savedObject
  alert("message="+savedObject.message);
  alert("nestedObject="+savedObject.nestedObject);
</code></pre>

<p>The key for <code>historyStorage</code> must be a string, while the
value can be an arbitrary JavaScript object. The RSH framework will fully
serialize your JavaScript object and pull it back out as an object.
Note that DOM nodes and native browser objects, such as <code>XMLHttpRequest</code>,
will not be saved or persisted.</p>

<p>Both <code>historyStorage</code> and <code>dhtmlHistory</code>
have a few more methods that are useful in some cases; see the
source code for details.</p>

<a name="internal"></a><h2>How Does It Internally Work?</h2>

<p>RSH works differently internally for different browsers, but in general
we use a combination of hidden iframes, timers, and hidden form fields
to detect various history changes and to persist history and location data
in a way that will still be around if the user leaves and then returns
to the page. The hidden form field is used to persist information 
between page loads using the auto save 
capability of web forms; see my blog 
post <a href="http://codinginparadise.org/weblog/2005/08/ajax-tutorial-saving-session-across.html">
"AJAX Tutorial: Saving Session Across Page Loads Without Cookies, 
On The Client Side"</a> for implementation details. <code>historyStorage</code> 
wraps the auto save trick with an easy hash table API for developers, and 
the main RSH framework then uses the <code>historyStorage</code> class to implement 
stateless tracking of history; variables that allow the detection of fake 
versus real page load events; and more.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safari is not supported.</li>
  <li>On Internet Explorer, if you add a location
  to <code>dhtmlHistory</code> that matches the ID of <i>any</i>
  HTML element already in the document, then you will get very strange
  behavior. It is recommended that you make sure these don't collide.
  For example, if I have an HTML DIV with the ID "addressBook," and then
  add the location "addressBook" to <code>dhtmlHistory</code> using
  <code>add()</code>, then IE's history won't work correctly and you
  will have subtle bugs.</li>
